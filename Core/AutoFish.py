# FIXES RIGHT NOW:
# We want the app to say that the app has started
# We want the app to start by pressing 2 - to start the macro for adding the lure
# We want wait until the lure is attached and the fishing pole is equiped (say X seconds or so)
# We want then start the main script of looking for the splash
# 
# Lets add fishing bot initialized now,  waiting for user to press spacebar (start)

# QoL Features:

# We will need to reapply lure after 10mins.
# Really what we want, is the ability to set the border region each time we start the app.
# We also want to be able to select between Retail, Cata, and Classic splash color code
# We want the information to not be in the terminal but on the screen when an event fires (found color, didn't find color, started app, etc)
# We want to be ab
# le to play and stop the 'fishing line events' while it's running (there's a difference between stopped and exited)
# Be able to gracefully exit the application (not pressing ctrl+c to cancel)
# We want to gracefully be able to add the fishing lure anytime we want
# SPECIFICALLY FOR MIKEL - Is there a better way to find the color code for the splash animation?? (He doesn't like MSS, even though it's fucking working.)
